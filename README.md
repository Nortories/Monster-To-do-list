# Overview

The HTML file can be run in a web browser. Within the HTLM is javascript that handels all the interations that the user does on the HTML page.

I wrote JavaScript to allow the user to create a list of task and setting each task with a priority level. After the list of tasks has been created the user then can then keep track of completed tasks by checking the checkbox next to each task. This program is an extention of my first JavaScript code of adding two numbers together and displaing the results. I featured the addition in the bottem portion of the HTLM and scripting to help compare and show my growth in the JavaScript and HTML language.

I wrote this software to help streach my understanding of JaveScript and aid me in another program project labled Monsters by creating a list of to do tasks.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
